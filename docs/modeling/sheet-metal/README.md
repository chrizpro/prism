## Verification

[Sheet metal tests](../../../Prism.Tests/Headless/SheetMetal/SheetMetalTests.cs) check Flange volume and bounds for both metal sides, width direction (forward, reversed, centred), hem, a two-bend channel and rejected profiles; Flat Pattern size and bend allowance for three K-factors, placement and the no-bend error; and Flatten / Refold on the documented radius 25 × 70 mm cylinder for each Create choice. Run `./tools/test.ps1 -Feature SheetMetal`. [Flatten and Refold](../../flatten-refold.md) also has its standalone suite.

Windows verification on 2026-11-05: the combined candidate passed 86 Unit and 592 Headless tests with rebuilt native libraries. See the [integration verification report](../../engineering/release-readiness-2026-11-05.md) for source revisions, commands and limits.
